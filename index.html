        There was a vision for this website, however,
        due to the complexities of coding and utilizing software catered to
        millions of different people, that vision was not fully fleshed out.
        What we have here is a compromise to that vision.</h6> -->
      <!-- <h6 class="hidden">Thank you HTML and CSS, dreams have been crushed </h6> -->
      <h6 class="hidden">After a long revision process with peer feedback and graded feedback,
        I have become more satisfied with this final product. As He looked back at His work,
        He saw that it was good.</h6>
      <h6 class="hidden">P.S. Have a great summer! </h6>
