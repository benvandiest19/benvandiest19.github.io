      <h5 class="hidden">I created this webpage with my bare hands. Took countless hours and
        drove me mad half the time. But hey, the finished product isn't half bad.
        Right? </h5>
      <h6 class="hidden">Ignore the overwhelming issues and formatting concerns.
        There was a vision for this website, however,
        due to the complexities of coding and utilizing software catered to
        millions of different people, that vision was not fully fleshed out.
        What we have here is a compromise to that vision.</h6>
      <h6 class="hidden">Thank you HTML and CSS, dreams have been crushed </h6>
